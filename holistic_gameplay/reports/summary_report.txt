FRAME STATISTICS
----------------
Total frames scanned:     24,265
Game frames detected:     11,854 (48.9%)
Non-game frames:          12,411 (51.1%)

GAME FRAME CHARACTERISTICS
---------------------------
Average brightness:       28.5 / 255
Average aspect ratio:     1.78

UI COLOR PRESENCE
-----------------
Cyan (UI elements):       93.4% of game frames
Yellow (text/warnings):   71.2% of game frames
Red (alarms/threats):     92.2% of game frames

INSIGHTS
--------
✓ Cyan UI elements are nearly universal - excellent anchor for detection
✓ Yellow text appears frequently - good for secondary detection
• Red elements present in 92.2% of frames - likely alarm states

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Review spatial heatmaps to identify stable UI regions
2. Examine color distribution for distinctive signatures
3. Query database for element co-occurrence patterns
4. Build element presence matrix for clustering analysis
