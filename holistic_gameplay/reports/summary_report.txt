======================================
Generated: /Users/shaun/git/qm/invisible_inc/holistic_gameplay

FRAME STATISTICS
----------------
Total frames scanned:     37,264
Game frames detected:     19,192 (51.5%)
Non-game frames:          18,072 (48.5%)

GAME FRAME CHARACTERISTICS
---------------------------
Average brightness:       29.6 / 255
Average aspect ratio:     1.77

UI COLOR PRESENCE
-----------------
Cyan (UI elements):       91.0% of game frames
Yellow (text/warnings):   73.1% of game frames
Red (alarms/threats):     93.0% of game frames

INSIGHTS
--------
✓ Cyan UI elements are nearly universal - excellent anchor for detection
✓ Yellow text appears frequently - good for secondary detection
• Red elements present in 93.0% of frames - likely alarm states

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Review spatial heatmaps to identify stable UI regions
2. Examine color distribution for distinctive signatures
3. Query database for element co-occurrence patterns
4. Build element presence matrix for clustering analysis
