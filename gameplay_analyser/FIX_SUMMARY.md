# Structural Detector v1.3.0 - Fix Summary

## üéØ Problem Fixed

**Opponent turn frames had 0% viewport detection** because:
- Power/credits text sometimes missing
- Fallback method too strict (needed 3+ edges)
- No temporal consistency between frames

**Result:** Only 5/12 test frames (41.7%) had viewport detected

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Strategy Viewport Inference**
Four fallback methods in order of preference:

1. **Power text** (when present) - most accurate
2. **Hamburger + Tactical View** (always present) - works on opponent turns!
3. **Temporal consistency** - inherit from previous frame
4. **Relaxed fallback** - only needs 2 edges now (was 3)

### 2. **Temporal Viewport Cache**
- Stores last successful viewport detection
- Class-level variable survives across frames
- Allows opponent frames to inherit from nearby player frames
- Call `StructuralDetector.reset_temporal_cache()` when starting new session

### 3. **Batch Processing Script**
- Processes frames in sequence (maintains temporal consistency)
- Automatically resets cache at session start
- Shows progress and statistics
- Proper handling of frame sequences

## üß™ How to Test

### Quick Test (single frame)
```bash
python structural_detector.py frame_000032.png
```

### Proper Test (frame sequence)
```bash
python batch_structural_detector.py captures/20251022_201216/frames
```

### Re-run Your Analysis
```bash
# Use your existing test script with new detector
./test_structural_detector.sh captures/20251022_201216 ./structural_detector.py

# Analyze results
python analyze_structural_results.py captures/20251022_201216/structural_test_results
```

## üìä Expected Results

**Before (your test):**
```
Viewport detected: 5/12 (41.7%)
  - Player frames: 5/5 (100%)
  - Opponent frames: 0/7 (0%)     ‚Üê PROBLEM
```

**After (predicted):**
```
Viewport detected: ~11-12/12 (~95-100%)
  - Player frames: 5/5 (100%)
  - Opponent frames: 6-7/7 (85-100%)  ‚Üê FIXED
```

**Why not 100%?**
- First opponent frame may fail if no prior player frame
- User resizes window during opponent turn (acceptable - will recover)
- Extremely rare cases where all methods fail

## üöÄ Key Improvements

‚úÖ **Hamburger + Tactical View inference** - works on opponent turns
‚úÖ **Temporal consistency** - frames inherit viewport from neighbors  
‚úÖ **Relaxed requirements** - only needs 2 edges (was 3)
‚úÖ **Batch processing** - proper session handling
‚úÖ **Better error recovery** - graceful degradation

## üí° Usage Notes

**For Sequential Processing (Recommended):**
```python
StructuralDetector.reset_temporal_cache()  # Start of session
detector = StructuralDetector()

for frame in frames:
    detector.detect_anchors(frame)
    viewport = detector.infer_viewport()  # Uses temporal consistency!
```

**For Random Access:**
```python
# Each frame independent, no temporal cache
detector = StructuralDetector()
viewport = detector.infer_viewport()  # Won't use temporal
```

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Test the improvements** on your 12 frames
2. **Check opponent frame viewport detection** (should be ~85-100% now)
3. **Verify element detection improves** once viewport is available
4. **Consider fixing remaining issues**:
   - agent_icon_2 detection (62.5% ‚Üí aim for 85%+)
   - security_clock detection (16.7% ‚Üí aim for 80%+)
   - inventory detection (8.3% ‚Üí need to investigate)

The viewport fix is the critical foundation - once that's solid at ~95%+, we can improve the other element detections.
